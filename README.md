# E-Commerce Platform

## Project Description
This E-Commerce Platform is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users, managing everything from product browsing to payment processing. Built with a microservices architecture, this application ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient handling of various business operations. The backend is powered by Java Spring Boot, while the frontend is developed using React, creating a robust and interactive user interface.

## Services
The application is divided into the following microservices, each handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce platform:

1. **User Management Service**
    - Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
    - Handles roles and permissions for different types of users (e.g., customers, administrators).

2. **Product Catalog Service**
    - Manages product listings, categories, and inventory.
    - Allows administrators to add, update, and delete products.

3. **Order Management Service**
    - Handles order creation, tracking, and history.
    - Manages order statuses (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).

4. **Payment Service**
    - Processes payments and integrates with various payment gateways.
    - Ensures secure transactions and maintains transaction history.

5. **Shopping Cart Service**
    - Manages user shopping carts, including adding, removing, and updating items.
    - Persists cart data across user sessions.

6. **Review and Rating Service**
    - Allows users to review and rate products.
    - Moderates and displays reviews to help other users make informed decisions.
